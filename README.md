# The study tools website v0

This is an early version of a study tools website that I am creating. It currently has very basic features such as a timer, stopwatch, to do list, a linked spotify playlist, and a linked youtube playlist.
The website was created using React, and currently has no database connected. A future version will include a login/logout feature that includes a connection to a database to hold user information.
